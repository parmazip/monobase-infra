# Compliance Checklist

Compliance guide for Monobase Infrastructure deployments supporting healthcare and other regulated industries.

## Overview

This infrastructure template is designed to support compliant deployments for various regulatory frameworks (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR, etc.). However, **infrastructure alone does not guarantee compliance** - organizational policies, procedures, and appropriate agreements are also required.

## HIPAA Compliance (Healthcare)

If you're deploying healthcare applications handling Protected Health Information (PHI), this section provides HIPAA-specific guidance.

## Summary

**Compliance Status:**
- ✅ **Technical Safeguards:** Fully implemented
- ✅ **Encryption:** At rest + in transit
- ✅ **Access Controls:** RBAC + NetworkPolicies
- ✅ **Audit Logs:** Enabled with configurable retention
- ✅ **Backup/DR:** 3-tier, tested monthly
- ⚠️ **Administrative:** Organization must document policies
- ⚠️ **Physical:** Cloud provider responsibility (via agreements)
- ⚠️ **Agreements:** Organization must sign appropriate agreements (BAA for HIPAA, DPA for GDPR, etc.)

**This infrastructure provides the technical foundation for regulatory compliance. Organizations must complete organizational requirements (policies, training, appropriate agreements) for full compliance.**

**Note:** This guide focuses on HIPAA as an example. For other frameworks (SOC 2, GDPR, PCI-DSS), consult with your compliance team to map these controls to your specific requirements.
